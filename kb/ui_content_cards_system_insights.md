# UI Content Cards — “How the Australian Visa System Works” (MVP copy set)

**Last updated:** 2026-02-23  
**Use:** Onboarding, dashboard side panels, explainer modals  
**Style:** Plain language, readiness framing, no outcomes/guarantees

---

## Card: High-volume temporary + capped permanent

Australia runs a **high-volume temporary visa system** alongside a **capped permanent migration program**.  
That means many people move through temporary visas (including extensions and transitions), while permanent places are limited and often competitive.

**Why this matters:** preparation quality and timing can materially reduce avoidable friction.

## Card: What KangaVisa does (and does not do)

KangaVisa helps you build a **decision-ready pack**: evidence checklists, timelines, and fixable flags.  
It **does not** lodge applications for you and **does not** predict outcomes.

---

## Card: “Checklist” vs “Satisfaction” decisions

Some visa criteria are objective (documents, dates, points).  
Others involve **satisfaction** (for example, whether an applicant is “genuine”).  
In satisfaction-heavy categories, **clarity and evidence quality** matter as much as meeting minimum requirements.

---

## Card: Why backlogs create “visa limbo”

When processing times stretch out, more people rely on bridging and transition pathways.  
This increases complexity: more documents, more timing constraints, and more change risk.

---

## Card: Policy volatility

Visa programs change regularly: thresholds, occupation lists, fees, and priority settings.  
KangaVisa monitors official updates and flags when a change might affect your readiness plan.

---

## Card: Evidence quality is the biggest avoidable risk

Many refusals and delays are driven by:
- missing documents
- inconsistent dates or claims
- weak explanations for key decision questions
- poor alignment between claims and evidence

KangaVisa is designed to surface these issues early, while they are still fixable.

---

## Card: Processing speed (expectations only)

Some categories tend to be faster than others — but timelines can change.  
KangaVisa shows “Verified on” dates and highlights when guidance may be stale.

---

## Card: When to seek professional advice

If your case is complex (points-tested pathways, character issues, prior refusals, or unusual circumstances), you may benefit from advice from a **registered migration agent** or lawyer.  
KangaVisa can export a structured pack that makes professional review faster and cheaper.
