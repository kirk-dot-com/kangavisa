# Seed Flag Library — Systemic Risk Patterns (Readiness Framing)

**Last updated:** 2026-02-23  
**Purpose:** Translate the “system snapshot” into **starter FlagTemplate themes** for the KB team.  
**Important:** These are **not determinations**. Each flag must be backed by Tier 0/1 citations and effective-dated KB objects.

---

## How to use
For each theme below, implement:
- a `FlagTemplate` with:
  - `trigger_schema` (inputs / detection rule)
  - `why_it_matters` (plain language)
  - `actions` (fix steps)
  - `evidence_examples` (what typically reduces risk)
  - `sources` (Tier 0/1)
- link it to one or more `Requirement` objects by visa stream

## A) Cross-category flags

### FLAG: Missing evidence category
- **Trigger:** checklist item(s) high priority missing
- **Why:** decisions are evidence-based; missing categories create avoidable RFIs or refusal risk indicators
- **Actions:** upload/replace documents; add notes; request issuer letters early
- **Evidence examples:** formal documents + statutory declarations where appropriate

### FLAG: Date mismatch / timeline inconsistency
- **Trigger:** conflicting dates across forms/docs (employment, study, travel, relationship milestones)
- **Why:** inconsistencies reduce credibility and can trigger extra scrutiny
- **Actions:** correct records; add an explanation note; reconcile names/aliases
- **Evidence examples:** payslips, enrolment letters, leases, utility bills, bank records, official statements

### FLAG: Identity detail mismatch
- **Trigger:** name/spelling/DOB/passport mismatch across documents
- **Why:** can cause delays or RFI; sometimes triggers integrity checks
- **Actions:** correct and re-upload; add official name change docs; ensure translations
- **Evidence examples:** passport bio page, birth cert, change of name cert, NAATI translations

### FLAG: Stale guidance risk (Tier 1)
- **Trigger:** guidance source older than threshold (e.g., 30 days) OR KB release older than user’s intended lodgement window
- **Why:** policy volatility; thresholds and settings can change
- **Actions:** refresh sources; re-run readiness check; review any new change events
- **Evidence examples:** N/A (system flag)

## B) Student (500) themes

### FLAG: “Genuine” narrative not supported
- **Trigger:** user intent statement is generic OR lacks evidence categories (career alignment, ties, plan)
- **Why:** satisfaction-based assessment; weak narrative is a recurring pattern
- **Actions:** add structured statement; attach supporting evidence; clarify study-to-career logic
- **Evidence examples:** employment history, course rationale, financial plan, ties evidence, prior study records

### FLAG: Financial evidence inconsistency
- **Trigger:** amounts don’t align, missing sources of funds, unexplained deposits
- **Why:** financial capacity is a key scrutiny area
- **Actions:** provide statements; provide source-of-funds explanation; align totals
- **Evidence examples:** bank statements, sponsor evidence, income docs, asset evidence

---

## C) Temporary Graduate (485) themes

### FLAG: Lodgement timing risk
- **Trigger:** key documents not available “at lodgement” (police checks, completion evidence)
- **Why:** strict sequencing issues can create avoidable refusal/invalid application risk indicators
- **Actions:** confirm timing; obtain required docs; lodge only when preconditions are met
- **Evidence examples:** completion letter, AFP check, relevant certificates, English results (where required)

---

## D) Employer sponsored (482 / SID/TSS settings) themes

### FLAG: Nomination evidence gap
- **Trigger:** role description, salary or market rate evidence incomplete
- **Why:** employer-side compliance is often the friction point
- **Actions:** gather nomination docs; check contract/salary evidence; confirm role alignment
- **Evidence examples:** employment contract, org chart, labour market docs, salary benchmarking evidence

---

## E) Partner (820/801 + 309/100) themes

### FLAG: Weak relationship evidence coverage (four pillars)
- **Trigger:** missing evidence across financial/household/social/commitment categories
- **Why:** partner decisions are evidence-heavy; imbalance is a common weakness
- **Actions:** build a structured index; add timeline; attach evidence per pillar
- **Evidence examples:** joint finances, shared bills, cohabitation proof, social evidence, travel, photos with context, statements

### FLAG: Timeline gaps in relationship narrative
- **Trigger:** long unexplained gaps in cohabitation/contact or inconsistent milestones
- **Why:** narrative credibility and continuity matter
- **Actions:** add explanations; corroborate with objective evidence
- **Evidence examples:** messages logs summaries, travel itineraries, leases, third-party statements

---

## F) Skilled points-tested (189/190/491) themes (Phase 2 emphasis)

### FLAG: Points claim not evidenced
- **Trigger:** claimed points not supported by documents/assessments
- **Why:** objective miscalculation is a recurring error pattern
- **Actions:** reconcile claims to evidence; update points plan; confirm assessments
- **Evidence examples:** skills assessment, English test results, employment references, qualifications
