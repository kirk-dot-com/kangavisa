## 1) Product narrative (why KangaVisa exists)

Australia’s visa system is high-volume, rules-heavy, and frequently changing. Many applicants and sponsors experience avoidable friction because success depends not just on meeting minimum requirements, but on **evidence quality**, **timing/sequence**, and **clarity in discretionary (“satisfaction”) criteria**.

**KangaVisa’s wedge** is not “AI advice”. It is **readiness**:
- pathway shortlisting (with assumptions)
- evidence mapping (checklists)
- consistency checks (timelines + contradictions)
- explainable risk flags (trigger → why → actions)
- decision-ready export packs (manual upload to ImmiAccount)

## 2) Onboarding story arc (plain-language)

### Step 1 — The system has two speeds
Australia combines a **high-volume temporary** system with a **capped permanent** program.  
This can create “visa limbo” for people transitioning onshore.

### Step 2 — Some decisions are documentary, some are “satisfaction”
Many requirements are objective (documents, dates, thresholds).  
Others involve satisfaction (e.g., “genuine” intent), where clarity and evidence coherence matter.

### Step 3 — Policy changes are normal
Requirements and thresholds can shift. KangaVisa monitors official sources and warns when guidance may have changed.

### Step 4 — The biggest avoidable risk is evidence quality
Common avoidable friction: missing documents, mismatched dates, weak explanations, and poor alignment between claims and evidence.

## 3) Investor / Government framing (one-page)

### Problem (system-level)
- High-volume intake creates operational load.
- Backlogs and appeals increase uncertainty and onshore transition complexity.
- Policy volatility and discretion-heavy criteria increase user confusion.

### Solution (KangaVisa)
A compliance-first platform adjacent to ImmiAccount that:
- reduces avoidable errors through readiness packs
- improves transparency with explainable flags + audit trails
- generates privacy-safe aggregated insights to support operational planning (GovData)

### Why it matters
This is high-stakes workflow software disguised as “advice”.
The product value is **structured, verifiable outputs** (not predictions).

## 4) Allowed copy blocks (ready to paste)

### One-liner
KangaVisa helps you prepare a decision-ready visa application pack—clear, structured, and explainable.

### Trust line (required)
KangaVisa is an information and preparation tool. It is not legal advice and does not guarantee outcomes.

### System expectations (safe)
- “Visa programs change regularly. We show ‘Verified on’ dates and warn if guidance may be stale.”
- “Some criteria involve decision-maker satisfaction. Clear evidence and coherent timelines can reduce avoidable friction.”

## 5) Disallowed statements (until verified with citations)
- Exact numeric totals (lodgements, holders, on-hand counts) presented as “official” without source links.
- Clause references presented as controlling law unless mapped to Tier 0 FRL sources and effective dates.
- Any claims implying outcomes or refusal probability.
